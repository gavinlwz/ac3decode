 * AC3DEC_WAVE
 * -----------
 *  v0.04 - added rudimentary AC3 frame-length checking/syncing
 *          to reject excessively-short frames *BEFORE* they are passed
 *          to ac3dec
 *          also, changed my_fread()'s mode of operation for g_fUseDemuxer == 0,
 *          The demuxQ is *always* used now, even when reading a normal *.AC3
 *          file. (The new frame-checker requires the demuxQ.)
 *  v0.02 - first release
 *          wrapper function for fread()
 *
 *  This file provides functions which "mediate" read-requests from
 *  ac3dec's bitstream_load(), and write-operations from demux_ac3(). 
 *
 *  The demux-buffer (g_ac3demuxQ) is a C++ object, the *only* C++ object
 *  in this entire package.
