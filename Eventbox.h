// generated messages into "command" and "status" categories, respectively.

// When the wave-device (play or record) finishes using a buffer, the
// device generates a WOM_DONE message (sent to our callback function.)
//
// The callback function does 2 things (in this order) :
//		1) stores the pointer to the released buffer (*lpParam)
//		2) signals the event  (sets the hE handle)
